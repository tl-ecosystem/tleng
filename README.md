TLeng2 (pronounced: tlenk-two) is a game engine that supports python (with the pygame-ce, pymunmk and NumPy modules) and C++ (work in progress).

A powerful and versatile 2D game engine that harnesses the power of ECS. It is fast, visually appealing, and, most importantly, highly extendable. Every TLeng2 user can create and utilize pre-existing community plugins to enhance their games or contribute to the community, enabling more game development without worrying about the backend.

On every single general release update there always will be an example game, in the `examples` folder.

The C++ version of the engine is a work in progress, but it will be available soon! 

After the C++ section will be finished, the engine will change names from TLeng2 to TLeng3. TLeng2 aims only for support with python, TLeng3 aims to support python and C++ together.

## ‚ö° Setting Up the Engine

It is recommended that everytime you create a game in `Tleng` you create a `Virtual Enviroment`. That is to resolve any conflicts that might arise from namespaces and more (`Tleng` uses `Pygame-CE` which conflicts with `Pygame`).

Here is how to create a `virtual enviroment`:

```bash
python -m venv name_of_your_virtual_enviroment
```

Then you want to activate the `virtual enviroment`:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now install the `TLeng` game engine with `pip`:

```bash
pip install tleng
```

Create a directory that is going to host your game files:

```bash
mkdir my_game_name
cd my_game_name
```

After that you can create a `main.py` file:

```bash
touch main.py
your_preferred_editor main.py
```

Import `tleng2` and start developing games!

The suggested file structure in `tleng` is this:
```
app_name/
 |- assets/
 |  |- images/ ...
 |  |- sound/ ...
 |  |- fonts/ ...
 |
 |- src/
 |  |- tleng2/ ... (*)
 |  |- menu.py
 |  |- settings.py
 |  |- level.py
 |  |- ai_movement.py
 |
 |- main.py
```

Explanation:
- An `assets` directory that you can structure as you wish, the structure sgoen in the example is not definitive.
- A `src` directory that contains all the source files of the game, sctipts, scenes etc.
- The `main.py` file exists to setup the entirity of the game at startup. It links all the scenes, specifys the plugins used and more.

(*) If you want to make modifications to the game eninge, then it's recommended that you import all the game engines files into your src folder. 


## ‚ùì Versions meaning (2.x.y.z):

2 = the engine is 2d (and because it's better than the previous try)

x = The general full release version

y = The bug fix version for the general release

z = is either Beta/Alpha/dev/exp of the general release or the bug fix version (exp : experimental)
