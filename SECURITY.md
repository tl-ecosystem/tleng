# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The newest version will always be supported.

If the vulnerability is big then it will be changed whatever the version is.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| <2.0.x  | ❎ |
| <2.2-dev| :white_check_mark: |

(2.2-dev is being developed)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a Vulnerability in the code please open an issue or go to "Security Advisories". 

It's possible that if the version that the vulnarability was found is old from the current one, then I will make sure that it gets fixed on the new version rather than the old one. 

## The numbers on the version of the engine indicate:

The meaning behind the symbolising of the updates are 2.x.y-z:
- 2 = the engine is 2d (and because it's better than the previous try)

- x = The general full release version

- y = The bug fix version for the general release

- z = is either Beta/Alpha of the general release (or rarely on the fixes)

In this situation, the y is responsible on showing the new update fixes. Logs on what was fixed would always be on the releases tab.
